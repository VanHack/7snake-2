# 7snake
Given a grid (10x10 for instance), this program identifies in this grid two 7-snakes that the sum of their values are equals and both doesn't have conflicted cells.

This solution was developed with Java 8 using Eclipse IDE. The results are printed on console.

If you want to execute this code you have two options:

1) Open the project in a IDE like Eclipse and Run the class Main.java.
First you have to specify some parameters to execute it.

Arguments: "/my-workspace/7snake/src/grid.csv" or "/my-workspace/7snake/src/grid.csv 2"

2) Or execute the class Main using command line.

java br.lucio.snake7.Main grid.csv (print the first 7-Snake found)
java br.lucio.snake7.Main grid.csv 3 (in this case, print the first 3 7-Snake found)
